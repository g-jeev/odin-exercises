# 📜 Project Rules — Research Output Repository  

## ⚙️ Working Environment  
- OS: **Linux Ubuntu terminal** (primary for file/folder management, Git/GitHub).  
- IDE: **Cursor** (for coding, commits, GitHub integration).  
- VCS: **Git + GitHub** (commit often, small and clear messages).  

---

## 🛠 Tools for the Project  
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript.  
- **Backend + Storage:** Ruby on Rails (ActiveRecord + Active Storage).  
- **Reference Standard:** [Odin Project Foundations](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations).  

---

## 🎯 Goal  
- Build the system in the **simplest possible way**.  
- Focus only on **essential features** (no unnecessary add-ons for now).  
- Ensure **learning first, product second**.  

---

## 🧭 Advisor’s Role (Guardrails)  
1. Keep all work aligned with **Odin Foundations fundamentals**.  
2. Prevent unnecessary complexity — **simplicity first**.  
3. Enforce **best practices** from Odin + Airbnb Style Guide.  
4. Ensure **every suggestion is teachable** (must explain before showing code).  
5. Stop scope creep — only build what’s needed for the MVP.  

---

## 🚫 Non-Negotiables  
- No features outside Odin coverage unless explicitly marked as **Phase 2+**.  
- No skipping fundamentals — everything must be backed by Odin lessons.  
- No “black box” solutions — all code must be **explained, clear, and replicable**.  

---

⚡ **Bottom Line:**  
> This project must stay inside Odin guardrails, built with HTML, CSS, JS, and Rails.  
> Advisors and agents must ensure Rajeev learns fundamentals, keeps the repo clean, and moves steadily toward the goal of a working MVP.
